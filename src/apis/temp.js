The fractional part of the lunation number during the given day:
a value of

0 corresponds to a new moon,
waxing crescent
0.25 to a first quarter moon,
waxing gibbous
0.5 to a full moon, and
waning gibbous
0.75 to a last quarter moon.
waning crescent

(The ranges in between these represent waxing crescent, waxing gibbous, waning gibbous, and waning crescent moons, respectively.)
